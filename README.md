The application should be a single page application consisting of the following:
* A search box for searching for movie titles from the OMDb API.
* A homepage displaying favorites and most popular movies
* A details page for a selected movie 
* A search results page
* The ability to mark movies as favourites.

OMDb is an Open Source movie database with an API available at https://www.themoviedb.org 

Feel free to create your own design. 

Requirements to the solution
The solution should be a single page application that works in both Chrome and Internet Explorer developed in Vue.js using pre-processed CSS (SCSS preferred) and Bootstrap.

The solution should be returned with full source code.

You will be evaluated both in how you build the front-end application (visually and technically) and how you communicate with the external API.

Make sure the application’s UI is responsive and looks good on any screen size, from mobile and tablets to laptops and desktop.
